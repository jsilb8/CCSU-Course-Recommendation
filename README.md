# CCSU-Course-Recommendation

   This repository contains class files representing different DB objects, and a course_processor.php file containing procedural functionality. The inputs are program(s) (major and/ or minor) and courses taken. Program(s) are used to generate major/ minor total requirements. Since every student has a general education requirement, general education total requirements are added to major/ minor total requirements to obtain total program requirements for any student. 
   Courses taken are applied toward total program requirements resulting in remaining program requirements. Then, the full list of courses that can fulfill/ work toward fulfilling total program requirements is populated. This list is filtered once down to just courses whose prerequisites have been met by courses taken. The list is filtered a second time down to just the courses available the term for which the student is enrolling. The final result is a complete list of available courses that can fulfill a program requirement.
   A priority (minimum distance from the final semester the course must be taken in order to graduate on time) is assigned to each course from the available list, and these priorities determine which courses are recommended, highest being first. The input course-load determines how many courses are recommended.
